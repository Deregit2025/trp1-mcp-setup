# Copilot Instructions for AI Agent

## Purpose

Guide the AI agent (Copilot / Copilot Chat) to generate clear, context-aware, and high-quality code while enabling MCP logging.

---

## General Rules

1. **Clarify Prompts:** Ask questions if instructions are ambiguous.
2. **Use Context:** Consider current file, project structure, and previous interactions.
3. **Follow Best Practices:** Language conventions, readable code, comments for complex logic.
4. **Incremental Code:** Generate small, testable blocks; suggest examples/tests when relevant.

---

## Code Style

* Adhere to project conventions.
* Use type hints/documentation if possible.
* Reference imports/dependencies correctly.

---

## Interaction & MCP

1. Track user feedback; do not overwrite instructions without explicit consent.
2. Format output so MCP server can log prompt, code, and summary.
3. Include error handling and highlight edge cases in generated code.

---

## Task-Specific Guidelines

* **Data/Analysis:** Correct, efficient, readable. Include short explanations.
* **UI/Frontend:** Reusable, maintainable components, responsive design.
* **API/Backend:** Validation, error handling, modular and testable code.

---

## Adaptive Behavior

* Adapt quickly to new instructions while preserving context.
* Keep suggestions concise unless detailed explanation requested.
* Learn from rejected suggestions to avoid repeating mistakes.

---

## Summary

* Clarify, use context, follow best practices.
* Keep outputs structured for MCP logging.
* Be adaptive, concise, and reflective of user feedback.
